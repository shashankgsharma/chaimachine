  <li>A chai maker machine that gives 3 chai options to the consumers</li>
  <li>The only option of buying is through 4 types of coins: 1rs, 2rs, 5rs and 10rs coins.</li>
  <li>The money is refunded back to the consumer if the paid price is less than the actual price of the tea.</li>
  <li>If the paid price is higher, the required change is returned to the user.</li>
  <li>The secret word: 'report' can be used to generate a report of available resources and money collected.</li>
  <li>The secret word: 'off' can be used to turn off the chai machine.</li>
